# Globeia - Blogs App

This is a Next.js Blogging App with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It allows users to create and list blogs. The individual blog pages, as well as the update and delete features, are works in progress.

The app is connected to an existing backend service built with MongoDB, and you can find the backend repository [here](https://github.com/manugeo/blog-list).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app's result. You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `app/pages` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
